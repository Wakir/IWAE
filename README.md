## IWAE

This repository contains a code and results for experiments conducted in paper "**Changing Lineup Classifier Ensemble for Drifting Imbalanced Data Streams**".

### Dependecies and setup

This work is done using Python 3.8.18 and stream_learn 0.8.21. Additional dependencies can be found in 'requirements.txt' file. To setup the repository you need to simple run a command in existing Python enviroment:

```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

### Running the Experiments

Running the experiment is done by calling function 'src/experiment1.py' or 'src/experiment2.py' with the desired input parameters. 

'Experiment1.py' contains experiment for synthetic datasets generated from 'StreamGenerator'.
'Experiment2.py' uses INSECTS dataset located in 'src/real_str'.

The hiperparameters uses in following experiments are:

* 'random_seeds' - The seeds used by the random number generator.
* 'imbalance' - Procentage of minority class in synthetic stream.
* 'scales' - tested sizes of the bootstrapped subsets concerning the original training set.
* 'n_classifiers' - the number of classifiers generated with one data chunk.
* 'base_classifier' - classifier type used in IMB-WAE and other reference methods.
* 'quality_measure' - metric used in pruning.
* 'reference_methods' - List of all reference methods used in experiment.
* 'metrics' - List of metric functions or single metric function.

### Results

Achived results are categoriased based on stream type ('Synthetic or 'INSECTS'). In the following subdirectories:
* 'full' - contains numpy files with full experiment results.
* 'tables' - contains excel tables with avareage results of the following experiments.
* 'plots' - contains comparison plots of proposed method and reference methods for each chunk in stream.
